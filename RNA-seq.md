**RNA-seq**

High-throughput sequencing techniques like Next Generation Sequencing are employed in RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to provide a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome, delivering superior depth and precision compared to traditional methods[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Z6Ah8q). RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) generates gene expression data and scRNA-seq is the most recent advanced RNA-seq measures gene expression from individual cells[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?rM7Ndi). In the field of RNA-Seq data analysis, algorithms based on machine learning (ML) are emerging as potent instruments for identifying sepsis biomarkers.The RNA-Seq workflow has seen significant improvements in various stages, including sample preparation, library construction, and data analysis. These advancements have allowed scientists to gain deeper insights into the complexities of transcription. While RNA-Seq is commonly used for studying polyadenylated messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, it can also be employed to examine other RNA types. These include total RNA, pre-mRNA, and various noncoding RNAs such as microRNA and long ncRNA[<sup>3</sup>](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?TLwlVT). The RNA-Seq workflow has seen significant improvements in various stages, including sample preparation, library construction, and data analysis.

These advancements have allowed scientists to gain deeper insights into the complexities of transcription. While RNA-Seq is commonly used for studying polyadenylated messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, it can also be employed to examine other RNA types. These include total RNA, pre-mRNA, and various noncoding RNAs such as microRNA and long ncRNA[<sup>4</sup>](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?vpa2T3). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) serves as a valuable technique for elucidating cancer biology by enabling comprehensive analysis of gene expression patterns and detecting cancer-specific novel transcripts, alternative splicing events, and gene fusions. This advanced method has greatly enhanced our capacity to discover biomarkers for cancer detection and outcome prediction, while also deepening our understanding of the molecular processes that drive cancer initiation and advancement[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?zw99tK)

**Application of Machine Learning and Data Science in RNA-seq** 

In the field of RNA-Seq data analysis, algorithms based on machine learning (ML) are emerging as potent instruments for identifying sepsis biomarkers[<sup>5</sup>](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?oiGv6O).In RNA-Seq data analysis, machine learning techniques enable researchers to effectively process extensive and intricate datasets, revealing patterns in gene expression, forecasting disease conditions, and identifying biomarkers. Researchers can gain more precise and comprehensive insights into RNA sequences and their biological significance by employing sophisticated algorithms such as deep learning, support vector machines, and random forests[<sup>6</sup>](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?J6b83h).There are many machine learning model have been build or use to detect or predict different type of cancer like ling cancer, liver cancer etc[<sup>7,8</sup>](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?KF2qnk)  &#x20;
